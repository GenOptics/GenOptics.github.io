    text: "One of the biggest challenges in Life Sciences is the high complexity and volume of the involved bio-data, as well as the lack of appropriate analysis tools that can be employed for the extraction of new knowledge.
    In the field of bioinformatics, there is an increasing trend towards the development of user-friendly tools forthe analysis and interpretation of large-scale bio-data, with a variety of specialized tools and managementapproaches available in recent literature. 
    <br><br><p><b>Goal of GenOptics is to implement a new platform for integrating, analyzing and visualizing multi-omics and other clinicobiogical data, by extending the functionality of established bioinformaticanalysis tools through an interactive visual dashboard</b></p>"
